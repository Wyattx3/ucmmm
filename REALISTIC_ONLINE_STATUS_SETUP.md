# 🟢 Realistic Online Status System

## ✨ New Features Added

### 📊 **What's Changed:**
- ❌ **Before:** All members always showed "Online"
- ✅ **After:** Realistic online/offline status with last seen timestamps

### 🎯 **Key Features:**
1. **Real-time Online Status** - Green dot for online users, gray for offline
2. **Last Seen Timestamps** - "Last seen 5m ago", "Last seen yesterday", etc.
3. **Activity Tracking** - Automatic online/offline based on user activity
4. **Idle Detection** - Goes offline after 5 minutes of inactivity
5. **Tab Visibility** - Handles browser tab switching and app backgrounding

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. **Add Database Fields**
Run the setup script to add presence tracking fields to your users collection:

```bash
# Install required dependencies (if not already installed)
npm install node-appwrite dotenv

# Run the database setup script
node setup-user-presence-fields.js
```

### 2. **Environment Setup**
Make sure your `.env` file has all required variables:

```env
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-server-api-key
```

**⚠️ Important:** You need a **Server API Key** (not just client key) to create database fields.

### 3. **Get API Key**
1. Go to [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
2. Select your project → Settings → API Keys
3. Create new key with **Database** permissions
4. Add it to your `.env` file as `APPWRITE_API_KEY`

### 4. **Wait for Processing**
After running the setup script:
- Database fields take 1-2 minutes to process
- Restart your development server: `npm run dev`

## 📱 How It Works

### **User Activity Tracking:**
```javascript
// Automatically tracks these events:
- Mouse movement and clicks
- Keyboard input
- Scrolling
- Touch interactions
- Tab visibility changes
```

### **Status Logic:**
```yaml
Online: User is actively using the app
Idle: No activity for 5+ minutes → goes offline
Offline: Browser tab closed or app backgrounded
Last Seen: Shows time since last activity
```

### **Status Display:**
```yaml
Chat List:
  - Green dot: User is online now
  - Gray dot: User is offline
  - Status text: "Online", "Last seen 5m ago", etc.

Chat Header:
  - Shows real-time status instead of always "Online"
  - Updates every 2 minutes automatically
```

## 🎨 Visual Changes

### **Before vs After:**

**Before:**
```
👤 John Doe
   Last message • 2:30 PM
   [Always showed "Online" in chat]
```

**After:**
```
👤 John Doe                    🟢
   Last message • 2:30 PM
   [Shows "Online" or "Last seen 5m ago"]
```

### **Status Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Green dot** = Online (active in last 3 minutes)
- ⚫ **Gray dot** = Offline (inactive or away)
- **Status text** = "Online", "Last seen 2h ago", "Last seen yesterday"

## 🔧 Database Schema

### **New Fields Added to `users` Collection:**
```yaml
isOnline: Boolean
  - default: false
  - whether user is currently active

lastSeen: DateTime  
  - timestamp of last activity
  - updates on every user action

lastActiveAt: DateTime
  - timestamp of last active session
  - used for calculating idle time
```

## 📈 Smart Status Simulation

For demo purposes, if database fields aren't available yet, the system falls back to **realistic status simulation**:

```javascript
// Simulates different user patterns:
- Always online users (very active)
- Day-time active users (8 AM - 10 PM)  
- Moderate activity users
- Rarely online users
- Completely offline users
```

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test the System:**
1. **Open app in browser** - You should appear online
2. **Switch tabs** - Your status goes offline
3. **Return to app** - Status goes back to online
4. **Leave idle for 5+ minutes** - Status changes to offline
5. **Check other users** - Should show varied realistic statuses

### **Expected Behavior:**
```yaml
Immediate: Status updates when you become active/inactive
Real-time: Other users see your status changes
Persistent: Status survives page refreshes
Realistic: Mix of online/offline users in the list
```

## ⚡ Performance

### **Optimizations:**
- **Bulk status loading** - Fetches all user statuses at once
- **Cached updates** - Only updates changed statuses
- **Minimal API calls** - Updates every 2 minutes, not constantly
- **Fallback simulation** - Works even without database fields

### **Activity Tracking:**
- **Passive listeners** - No performance impact on user interactions
- **Throttled updates** - Prevents excessive database writes
- **Background processing** - Status updates don't block UI

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Status Not Updating:**
```bash
# Check if database fields exist
# Go to Appwrite Console → Database → ucera-main → users → Attributes
# Should see: isOnline, lastSeen, lastActiveAt
```

### **Setup Script Fails:**
```bash
# Check API key permissions
# Ensure APPWRITE_API_KEY has Database permissions
# Verify environment variables are loaded correctly
```

### **Console Errors:**
```javascript
// Common errors and solutions:
"Unknown attribute: isOnline" → Database fields still processing, wait 2 minutes
"Missing API key" → Add APPWRITE_API_KEY to .env file  
"Insufficient permissions" → API key needs Database permissions
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the status system:

### **Advanced Features:**
- **Custom status messages** - "In a meeting", "Do not disturb"
- **Activity indicators** - "Typing...", "Recording voice message"
- **Push notifications** - Alerts when friends come online
- **Status history** - Analytics on user activity patterns

### **Group Features:**
- **Group online count** - "5 of 12 members online"
